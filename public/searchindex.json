FHIR for Anaesthesia Records (GF) a. IG GF presented a history and roadmap to date of the FHIR IG for intra-procedural anaesthesia records along with recent updates and forthcoming work. The scope is currently defined as “Informative” (I) within HL7. “Draft standard for trial use” (DSTU) and “normative” (N) are the progressive stages towards standardisation. There is a need for institutions of status to trial in order to move from I to DSTU.\nIf we can achieve support, we would approach the HL7 Steering Committee and request modify status of project.\nHowever, the IG needs substantially more fleshing out before we get to this.\nOnce we get towards completion, we should approach institutions to gain support for an application to move to DSTU.\nThe challenges were discussed around medication administration and procedures involving non-electromechanical devices. e.g. inhalation agents and gas flow delivered via vaporiser and breathing systems, TIVA/TCI.\nGrant ran through some of the examples for IV cannula and arterial line and feedback was given around ported versus un-ported intravenous devices and needle-free connector attachments. Comment was also made around device placement: ECG analysis used in addition to US.\nDevice properties and recording these was discussed. Comparison with automobile industry was made including exploration of possible side project with an industry partner.\nGF outlined next steps:\ncontinue with IG build on GitHub using existing tooling diagramming for complex use cases connect with VA project in the US possible demo/sandbox app as a companion to the IG b. DAM A domain analysis model (DAM) is the foundation resource that others will refer back to, e.g. an IG will refer back to a DAM.\nGrant presented the work and changes on the DAM to v1.1 and comments on the steps for the major procedure example (AAA repair).\nFeedback was given around glycaemic control +/- sampling of ABG from arterial line and current neuromuscular and depth of anaesthesia monitoring standards.\n2. Anaesthetic Records: an evaluation of their variation across England (RF) RF presented his paper on Anaesthetic Records and their variation across England . This included the argument for standardisation or the creation of a minimal dataset.\nGF discussed this was a useful addition to the available international literature. MG felt the non-response from departments was poor, and wondered if it reflected poor design/implementation in those departments. CR discussed some of the logistical issues as a result of migrating to an EAR system as part of a trust-wide EPR deployment. GF said there was a minimum dataset for US anaesthesia providers. It is not intended as an exchange of a data, but to ensure the care provider is correctly paid and as such is very exhaustive - almost to a fault. MH suggested international standards from Australia/NZ as a benchmark. JPL wondered that in the absence of any thrust to create guidelines or standards, SCATA should publish consensus standards based on Rich’s work and the available literature. “Minimum dataset for an anaesthetic record”. This could include a checklist for both paper/electronic records.\nNext steps:\nStandards work 3. Deployment of Epic at Guy\u0026rsquo;s \u0026amp; St. Thomas - lessons for open standards (CR) CR gave a broad presentation on this large piece of informatics work and outlined the overall project timelines. Infrastructure, training, shadow charting, clinical documentation, downtimes, and migration of data were all outlined alongside issues experienced along the way and how problems were solved.\n4. Website \u0026amp; branding work (JPL) Preview of website, login and branding work presented.\n5. Representation of Positioning Data in Perioperative Records (MG) MG presented “Terminology for per-operative anaesthetic records - what’s the problem?”, which he self-described as a narrative for grumpiness\u0026hellip;\n6. Logbook standards work (JPL) JPL presented work to date with Rob Penders and received helpful input and comment from the group.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/2023/sta-las-vegas/","title":"SCATA-STA Speaker Exchange: Las Vegas","description":"this is meta description","date":"February 1, 2023","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/destination-1853477_1280_hu02aa61ae1d9de35cbe238d2676170cb9_591779_420x0_resize_q80_h2_lanczos.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"240\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/destination-1853477_1280_hu02aa61ae1d9de35cbe238d2676170cb9_591779_420x0_resize_q80_lanczos.jpg';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/destination-1853477_1280_hu02aa61ae1d9de35cbe238d2676170cb9_591779_100x100_fill_q80_h2_lanczos_smart1.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/destination-1853477_1280_hu02aa61ae1d9de35cbe238d2676170cb9_591779_100x100_fill_q80_lanczos_smart1.jpg';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Reports","tags":"STA, Conference","content":"James Selby reports on his experience of the SCATA-STA Speaker Exchange Programme.\nSTA Annual Congress In January, as part of a speaker exchange program between SCATA and the Society of Technology in Anaesthesia (STA), I had the opportunity to travel to Las Vegas to present my work on computer simulations of target-controlled infusions at the STA Annual Congress. The STA is the USA equivalent of SCATA originally starting as a society just focused on technology, it later incorporated the American society of computing to have a similar remit of SCATA.\nThe conference was a four-day event themed around ‘Innovation in a Crisis’ covering topics including artificial intelligence, open anaesthetic records, the opioid crisis, medical device creation, healthcare supply chain and labour economics. These were delivered mainly as a single stream of lectures from various experts from around the world.\nMachine learning and its applications in anaesthesia was a frequent topic; with talks from analysing social media trends found in online anaesthesia forums, to closed loop infusion systems and extracting trends from Electronic Health Records. There was also a particular focus on medical device innovation, creation and engineering. Starting with moving from ideas to product creation all the way to completing FDA legislation to deliver products to the USA market.\nA talk that particularly interested me was on spatial analytics for health care systems. Spatial analytics is a subset of data science analysing and interpreting geographic and location-based data to gain insights and understanding of spatial patterns, relationships, and trends. The team at The Children\u0026rsquo;s Hospital of Philadelphia had studied the impact of location and social determinants of health on the paediatric patients within the perioperative pathways. Their analysis identified a range of trends. For example, the contributing patient and neighbourhood socioeconomic risk factors that increased the chance of arriving late to a hospital appointment. Or that the parents from a specific city location were less likely to consent for regional anaesthesia. This then led to targeted interventions to address these issues. They are now partnered with accuweather expanding their research into air quality which includes providing air quality measurement devices to patients.\nMy presentation was on opentiva which is an open-source python module that simulates target-controlled infusions that I created and maintain. For interest, the source code is hosted on GitHub at ‘github.com/opentiva’ with an example front-end web application at ‘opentiva.com’. The talk focused on the theory behind target- controlled infusions, and the design and implementation of my project. The presentation was well received and was of particular interest as TCI pumps are not licensed for clinical use in the USA, so TCI TIVA is not a well-known or performed technique.\nIn conclusion, my experience of attending and presenting at the STA Annual Congress in Las Vegas was a truly valuable and interesting one. It was fascinating to see the innovative work being done over in the USA. I look forward to hearing from the STA guest exchange speaker when they attend the SCATA conference later this year.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/2022/andrew-norton-obituary/","title":"Dr Andrew Norton - Obituary","description":"","date":"June 14, 2022","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/andrewnorton_hu0484a36f2511477c5fb58b48af856137_55066_420x0_resize_q80_h2_lanczos.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"240\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/andrewnorton_hu0484a36f2511477c5fb58b48af856137_55066_420x0_resize_q80_lanczos.jpg';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/andrewnorton_hu0484a36f2511477c5fb58b48af856137_55066_100x100_fill_q80_h2_lanczos_smart1.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/andrewnorton_hu0484a36f2511477c5fb58b48af856137_55066_100x100_fill_q80_lanczos_smart1.jpg';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Committee","tags":"Obituary","content":"Dr Andrew Norton, Past President and an early member of SCATA, was diagnosed with a malignancy some months ago. Initially, he\u0026rsquo;d responded well to radiotherapy and had begun a course of chemotherapy but subsequently had a sudden deterioration and died on the 12th May 2022.\nMartin Hurrell and I attended his funeral in Alford in Lincolnshire on the 9th June 2022, and then at Woodhall Spa Golf Club where Andrew was a member for many years.\nI\u0026rsquo;m very grateful to Martin, to Andrew\u0026rsquo;s brother Roger, to Andrew\u0026rsquo;s colleague Dr Gurdip Samra , consultant in Anaesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine at Pilgrim Hospital, and to Andrew\u0026rsquo;s widow, Pippa for their eulogies. The following draws to a great extent on their words from the service.\nAndrew Carey Norton 24th May 1955 to 12th May 2022 Andrew graduated from the London Hospital Medical College in 1981. His first house surgeon post was at the Royal East Sussex Hospital in Hastings , before returning to London for his second house physician post at Queen Mary’s Hospital in the East End. Now fully qualified, Andrew’s first post in anaesthesia was at Leicester Royal Infirmary, followed six months later by his first visit to Pilgrim Hospital in Boston. At the age of 26, he was embarking on a medical career that spanned four decades. After a 6-month post in Peterborough, he moved north, first to Glasgow, and ultimately to Aberdeen. Gaining the FFARCS in 1985, Andrew continued his post-fellowship career until 1990, when he was appointed to his first consultant post, returning south to the Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, Lincolnshire where he remained for 31 years. He held leadership roles in United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust , when it was formed by merger in 2000. He was an active member of the British Medical Association. In 2011, Andrew was awarded the FFICM and in 2012, he led the 4 million pound refurbishment of the ICU at Pilgrim Hospital, having the foresight to budget for and implement the Metavision digital care record system.\nAndrew joined the UK Society for Computing and Technology in Anaesthesia (SCATA) in 1991, just four years after its formation in 1987. Not one to hang about, just three years later he became Secretary. He subsequently occupied pretty much every position, Treasurer, Membership Secretary, Chairman and President. The current president, Grant Forrest, remembers how Andrew, while President, “… kept me in good spirits during my simultaneous tenure as Chairman, helping me with points of order in committee meetings and making every resource that he could available to me so that together, we could further the interests of the society as a whole”.\nIt was in his first years in SCATA that Andrew’s nascent and abiding interest in medical terminologies began. In 2001 the US Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) set up a Data Dictionary Task Force, chaired by Terri Monk. Its mission was to create a “Data Dictionary” for the specialty of anesthesia and Andrew, with his passion for terminology, joined as Content Director.\nIt became apparent that if the work of the group was to have wide impact, it would need to align with an international standard. The obvious choice was SNOMED CT , the leading international controlled terminology designed for use in IT systems, comprising over 350,000 concepts. Each concept has a unique identifier that allows a receiving system to know what information is represented, regardless of language.\nThe task for the group was to identify, from this huge pool of concepts, those with specific relevance for anesthesia and to organise them in a way that anesthesiologists would find useful. To say that this was not completely straightforward would be an understatement. It was painstaking work: long hours in windowless rooms, hammering out seemingly endless details. By the end of each day most of the team were more than ready for something cool in a long glass but Andrew, being made of sterner stuff, would often head for his hotel room to put in a couple more hours so that everything was ready for the next day. He also made notes on new terms that the group felt were needed, and put them forward as candidates for inclusion in a future SNOMED release.\nIn recent years, this work has passed to the Anaesthesia Clinical Reference Group of SNOMED CT which Andrew led, jointly, with Patrick McCormick and Andrew Marchant. Andrew was usually the anchor on the regular Zoom calls. He applied his huge expertise with patience and a dogged tenacity to get things right. Andrew Marchant recalls “Andrew\u0026rsquo;s kindness and generosity of spirit” and says of him “He had quite a professional profile and you always wonder whether such people will be approachable - once you met him, you very quickly knew that Andrew was going to be a sympathetic and encouraging listener”. Ian Green of SNOMED remembers Andrew as “A quiet, unassuming, knowledgeable leader”.\nAndrew was an active member of the HL7 Anesthesia Working Group . The HL7 work focuses on structural models and communication, relying on terminologies for detailed content. Andrew’s clinical experience was of great help in defining use cases and how content should be organised. Somehow, he persuaded his wife Pippa to attend some of the meetings and to record the minutes. Pippa set a standard that hasn’t been equalled subsequently.\nPerhaps even more significant than the universal respect that Andrew enjoyed was the great affection in which he was held. John Walsh from Massachusetts says “He always seemed kind … I was impressed by his helping out in his ICU after he had retired. He also appeared very non-judgmental when correcting us in our errant ways”. Ellen Torres, who lives in Oregon describes Andrew simply as “… a wonderful, special person!”\nOne of Andrew’s habits was to taunt the group by always finding himself a cheaper and better alternative to the official hotel in which each HL7 meeting was held. He seemed to be able to find places with Olympic-sized swimming pools and super-fast broadband for about $20 a night. Naturally, these were often some distance from the actual meeting but for Andrew, making the journey using complex combinations of public transport was just part of the challenge. He had an amazing gift for navigating strange cities and we found that the best way to avoid getting lost was to keep Andrew in sight at all times.\nHis dry humour, his appetite for doing work rather than seeking credit for it, and above all, the kindness and patience to which so many of his friends have referred will be missed. Isaac Newton said : “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants” and that perhaps implies that progress in science and medicine is founded on a sort of pyramid of genius. At least as important, possibly more so, is the quiet foundational work of people like Andrew who, so-to-say, lay the rails on which the trains run, and without which progress would be impossible.\nRecently, Andrew received the SNOMED CT Long Service Award which was richly deserved. Monica Harry, Director of Content and Mapping at SNOMED International said of Andrew: “He showed passionate dedication, over many years, to improving SNOMED CT for the benefit of his colleagues. Steadfast in his resolve, always gentle in his demeanour, yet politely persistent in his drive to get things right. Through his leadership, Andrew inspired others to take up the challenge”.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been a 20 year journey, but I’m sure Andrew would be pleased to know that, largely owing to his contributions, SNOMED CT has a comprehensive set of terms that will be invaluable to the digital system builders of the generations to come.\nIn addition to being a keen amateur golfer with a handicap of 10, Andrew was a music lover. At his memorial service, the attendees were treated to the distinctive vocals of John Fogerty and Credence Clearwater Revival (CCR) and their 1971 hit \u0026quot; Have You Ever Seen The Rain\u0026quot;. In their eulogies, his widow Pippa and brother Roger both made mention of Andrew\u0026rsquo;s wide-ranging musical tastes, from classical to modern ambient electronic and all stops between. Once, in answer to the question \u0026ldquo;what kind of music do you like?\u0026rdquo;, Andrew answered: \u0026ldquo;Everything, from Rock to Baroque\u0026rdquo;. If asked to pick a favourite, Andrew might have pointed to the Dutch band Golden Earring. Whilst the majority of us could name their hit \u0026ldquo;Radar Love\u0026rdquo;, their entire discography could be found in Andrew\u0026rsquo;s collection, along with a similar repository of the works of CCR. If he had a favourite genre, it would undoubtedly have been progressive rock, whether it was bands, supergroups, album covers or personnel, the breadth and depth of his knowledge was encyclopaedic. He and Pippa travelled widely, often to gigs in Europe and further afield, but the Skegness Embassy Theatre was their favourite spot for tribute bands.\nPippa recalls their wedding in Jamaica in 2003, specifically their return to Heathrow Airport where they paused in the arrivals hall for a quick coffee before attempting to locate their car. Having left Andrew seated in the cafe, she returned from a quick visit to a nearby store to find him missing, albeit with his suitcase still next to his chair. Alarmed by the absence of her new husband, concerned that he may have had a change of heart, her attention was drawn to a commotion in the area upstairs and to her right. An unfortunate soul had collapsed, and there was Andrew, administering CPR.\nThis was typical of Andrew - his selfless care, compassion, kindness and willingness to help others.\nAndrew and I were colleagues in SCATA for 25 years. I was struck by his modesty in relation to his personal achievements, his warm and gentle manner in both our business and social discourse, but above all, his genuine passion for the thornier aspects of clinical modelling and terminology. He never wavered in his desire to \u0026ldquo;get it right\u0026rdquo;, always leading by example.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/2022/alastair-lack-obituary/","title":"Dr Alastair Lack - Obituary","description":"","date":"May 9, 2022","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/alastairlack_hu2d24b59b24e174f35483a46be1d1aa2b_54442_420x0_resize_q80_h2_lanczos.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"240\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/alastairlack_hu2d24b59b24e174f35483a46be1d1aa2b_54442_420x0_resize_q80_lanczos.jpg';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/alastairlack_hu2d24b59b24e174f35483a46be1d1aa2b_54442_100x100_fill_q80_h2_lanczos_smart1.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/alastairlack_hu2d24b59b24e174f35483a46be1d1aa2b_54442_100x100_fill_q80_lanczos_smart1.jpg';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Committee","tags":"Obituary","content":"Obituary - Dr Alastair Lack\nWe learned in late March 2022 that Dr Alastair Lack, founding member of SCATA, had died aged 79.\nBoth the Times and the Salisbury Journal published obituaries this month. The BMJ published an obituary on 6th May 2022.\nSCATA\u0026rsquo;s first Chairman, he led the newly-founded society from 1987 until 1992 when he handed the reins over to Gavin Kenny. In 1996 he was appointed President, serving the society in that role for five years. He was subsequently nominated for lifelong Honorary Membership, in recognition of his major contribution to the ongoing work of the society.\nIn 2007, Alastair co-organised SCATA\u0026rsquo;s 20th anniversary meeting in London. It was a joint meeting with ESCTAIC , our European sister society. He later published a memoir of the early days of SCATA and ESCTAIC.\nAs recently as June last year (2021), he attended our virtual AMM on Zoom, curious to know how the specialist society and medical charity that he co-founded was faring in these modern times.\nSome 35 years after he co-founded SCATA, he will be remembered as a lively enthusiast for all things technical in our specialty.\n"}]
