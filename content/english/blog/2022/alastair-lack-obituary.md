Obituary - Dr Alastair Lack

We learned in late March 2022 that Dr Alastair Lack, founding member of SCATA,
had died aged 79.

Both the [Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/alastair-lack-obituary-5msjhr92d)
and the [Salisbury Journal](https://www.salisburyjournal.co.uk/features/living/health/20015041.tributes-flying-doctor-alastair-lack-died-aged-79/) published obituaries this month. The [BMJ](https://www.bmj.com/content/377/bmj.o1141)
published an obituary on 6th May 2022.

SCATA's first Chairman, he led the newly-founded society from 1987 until 1992 when he
handed the reins over to Gavin Kenny. In 1996 he was appointed President, serving the
society in that role for five years. He was subsequently nominated for lifelong Honorary
Membership, in recognition of his major contribution to the ongoing work of the society.

In 2007, Alastair co-organised SCATA's 20th anniversary meeting in London. It was a
joint meeting with [ESCTAIC](http://www.esctaic.org/), our European sister society. He
later published a [memoir](https://www.scata.org.uk/docs/SCATA_history_final.pdf) of the
early days of SCATA and ESCTAIC.

As recently as June last year (2021), he attended our virtual AMM on Zoom, curious to
know how the specialist society and medical charity that he co-founded was faring in these
modern times.

Some 35 years after he co-founded SCATA, he will be remembered as a lively enthusiast for
all things technical in our specialty.
