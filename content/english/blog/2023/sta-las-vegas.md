_James Selby reports on his experience of the SCATA-STA Speaker Exchange Programme._

#### STA Annual Congress

In January, as part of a speaker exchange program between SCATA and the Society
of Technology in Anaesthesia (STA), I had the opportunity to travel to Las Vegas to
present my work on computer simulations of target-controlled infusions at the STA
Annual Congress. The STA is the USA equivalent of SCATA originally starting as a
society just focused on technology, it later incorporated the American society of
computing to have a similar remit of SCATA.

The conference was a four-day event themed around ‘Innovation in a Crisis’
covering topics including artificial intelligence, open anaesthetic records, the opioid
crisis, medical device creation, healthcare supply chain and labour economics.
These were delivered mainly as a single stream of lectures from various experts
from around the world.

Machine learning and its applications in anaesthesia was a frequent topic; with talks
from analysing social media trends found in online anaesthesia forums, to closed
loop infusion systems and extracting trends from Electronic Health Records. There
was also a particular focus on medical device innovation, creation and engineering.
Starting with moving from ideas to product creation all the way to completing FDA
legislation to deliver products to the USA market.  

A talk that particularly interested me was on spatial analytics for health care
systems.  Spatial analytics is a subset of data science analysing and interpreting
geographic and location-based data to gain insights and understanding of spatial
patterns, relationships, and trends. The team at The Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia had studied the impact of location and social determinants of health on
the paediatric patients within the perioperative pathways. Their analysis identified a
range of trends. For example, the contributing patient and neighbourhood
socioeconomic risk factors that increased the chance of arriving late to a hospital
appointment. Or that the parents from a specific city location were less likely to
consent for regional anaesthesia. This then led to targeted interventions to address
these issues. They are now partnered with accuweather expanding their research
into air quality which includes providing air quality measurement devices to
patients.

My presentation was on opentiva which is an open-source python module that
simulates target-controlled infusions that I created and maintain. For interest, the
source code is hosted on GitHub at ‘github.com/opentiva’ with an example front-end
web application at ‘opentiva.com’. The talk focused on the theory behind target-
controlled infusions, and the design and implementation of my project. The
presentation was well received and was of particular interest as TCI pumps are not
licensed for clinical use in the USA, so TCI TIVA is not a well-known or performed
technique.

In conclusion, my experience of attending and presenting at the STA Annual
Congress in Las Vegas was a truly valuable and interesting one. It was fascinating to
see the innovative work being done over in the USA. I look forward to hearing from
the STA guest exchange speaker when they attend the SCATA conference later this
year.
