#### Logbook Technical Standards

SCATA was commissioned by the Royal College of Anaesthetists (RCoA) to produce a set of technical standards for logbook software.  These standards are intended to provide a set of minimum - and best practice - benchmarks for the development of logbook software and to ensure that the needs of anaesthetists are met.  The standards are intended to be used by developers of logbook software, by anaesthetists evaluating solutions, and by organisations that are considering developing or commissioning logbook software.
