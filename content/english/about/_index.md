Established in 1987, we are a specialist medical society and charity. Our aims are to:

- Promote, fund and disseminate the results of research into the use of technology in anaesthesia and perioperative care
- Promote and facilitate education and training in digital health, with a focus on perioperative care
- Work in partnership with similar organisations such as ESCTAIC in Europe and the STA in the United States
- Encourage engagement of clinicians in ISOs such as HL7-FHIR, OpenEHR and SNOMED-CT through membership and partnership

#### Our membership

Our members are a diverse group of current and former anaesthetists, intensivists, and perioperative physicians, as well as other healthcare professionals with an interest in digital health.

#### Our membership network

We use the Slack platform as a tool for communication and collaboration. All SCATA members are eligible to join the Slack workspace, where they can connect with other members, participate in discussions and working groups.
